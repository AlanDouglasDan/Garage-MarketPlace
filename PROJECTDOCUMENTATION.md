# Garage Marketplace App - Project Documentation

## Why I Chose This Project
The Garage Marketplace App addresses the practical problem of utilizing unused garage spaces for short-term storage. Inspired by the sharing economy model, this platform allows users to list and rent out their unused garage spaces.

I chose this project because it covers essential marketplace app features like:

- User authentication
- Data management
- Real-time interactions
- Integration with Supabase for backend
- Cross-platform mobile development with React Native and Expo

This project also offers potential for future expansion with features like location-based services, payments, and reviews.

## Stack & Tools Used

The following stack and tools were selected to build and scale the project:

### Frontend (React Native + Expo)

- **React Native**: For cross-platform mobile development (iOS & Android), chosen for fast development and flexibility.

- **Expo**: Simplifies building and testing the app on both platforms.

- **Redux**: Manages global state for a consistent data flow.

- **React Navigation**: Handles screen navigation for seamless user experience.

- **Supabase Client**: Powers the backend for authentication, database storage, and real-time features.

### Backend (Supabase)

- **Supabase**: Provides backend-as-a-service for user authentication, database operations, and real-time capabilities.

- **Supabase Auth**:For user authentication (sign up, log in, and account management).

- **Supabase Database**: Stores data for listings, user profiles, and bookings.

- **Supabase Storage**: Manages listing photos securely.

## Future Features to Complete the Project

### Google Places Autocomplete

- **Purpose**: Simplify location entry during listing creation by using the Google Places API for address autocomplete.
- **Implementation**: Integrate a search bar for locations in the Create Listing screen.

### Map Integration

- **Purpose**: Visualize listing locations on a map to help users choose based on proximity.
- **Implementation**: Use React Native Maps to display garage locations.

### Payment Integration (Stripe)

- **Purpose**: Allow users to pay for bookings via Stripe.
- **Implementation**: Integrate Stripe to process payments and store transaction details securely.

### Messaging System

- **Purpose**: Enable real-time communication between guests and hosts about listings and bookings.
- **Implementation**: Integrate a simple messaging system using Supabase Realtime.

## Scalability and Architecture Considerations

### UI/UX Polish

- Focus on a smooth, intuitive experience for key screens like listing creation, booking management, and profile management.

### Push Notifications

- **Purpose**: Notify users about booking confirmations, payments, and reminders.
- **Implementation**: Use React Native Push Notifications for real-time updates.

### Testing and Debugging

- Conduct unit tests and UI tests to ensure all features work across platforms.
- Debug performance issues (e.g., slow image loading or large datasets).

### Optimize for Performance

- **Purpose**: Ensure the app handles large data sets (listings, bookings) efficiently.
- **Implementation**: Implement lazy loading, pagination, and image compression for faster performance.

### Current Status
- Core features like user authentication, garage creation, booking management, and reviews are functional.
- Basic UI/UX is implemented and tested across platforms

### Next Steps
- Implement payment processing
- Add Google Places integration
- Develop messaging system
- Expand testing coverage
